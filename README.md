## Image to Lego Plates

Convert images to Lego Plate compatible colors. 

Example:
1. Upload image.
2. Scale to 32x32 (to match base plates)
3. Adjust color slider.
4. Download image.


This can be used to then count how many bricks of each color to buy, and build your own 2D Lego 1x1 tile/plate art.
